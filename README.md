## Project description

This is a simple client-server CRUD application that allows users to ask and answer questions.  
It uses [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), [passport.js](http://passportjs.org/) with [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and [thinky](https://github.com/neumino/thinky) along with [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com/) on a backend; [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) on front-end.  
Backend is tested using [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest), while front-end uses [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme).
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) are used for deployment.

## CI/CD

CI and CD for all the subprojects is done using [Gitlab-CI](https://gitlab.com/yamalight/building-products-with-js).
